          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>The year was 2013. Arin had just moved across the country from Vancouver, WA to start a new chapter in her career. Lincoln was looking for love in all the wrong places. Thanks to an app called Ok Cupid (and a mutual affinity for the musical artists Purity Ring and Kid Cudi), the two connected digitally â€“ then took it analog. The first date was at Dressel's Pub on snowy evening in late March. It went very well.</p>

          <p>...We still think about that app and how lucky we are to have found each other. As we merge our last names and vow to honor the other for life, we ask for your support and accountability.</p>
