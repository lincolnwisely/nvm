          <p>Can romance blossom from an algorithm? Are 1s and 0s the building blocks of love? Let's set the scene: Arin had just moved across the country from Vancouver, WA to start a new chapter in her career. Lincoln was looking for love in all the wrong places. Thanks to an app called Ok Cupid, the two connected digitally â€“ then took it analog. Arin and Lincoln met at Dressel's Pub for their first real date on snowy evening in late March. It went very well.</p>

          <p>In the past five years, we've adopted a second pupper, scored new jobs and bought a dang house! We still think about that app, and how lucky we are to have found each other. We cannot measure the gratitude we have for every person who has supported us.</p>
